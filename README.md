# Basic Games on Ruby

## About

My objective with this project was to improve on some programming logic and on Ruby language.

The original project is from a course on [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/introducao-a-programacao-com-ruby-e-jogos-1).

I just make some minor changes and translate into English.
